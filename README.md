# Starbucks_India_Location_Analysis

In this small analysis we can see that how a small piece of code in Python can generate such a powerful visualisation where Starbucks located in India are plotted on Map(Red marker: store with more footfall, Green markers: store with less footfall) using folium package and on the top of that we can even generate an individual graph for every data point.
This analysis can be useful in analysing the performance of starbucks store and in deciding where to open new store.
